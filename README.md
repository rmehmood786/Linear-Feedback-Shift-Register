# Linear Feedback Shift Register (LFSR) Implementation

This Python script simulates a Linear Feedback Shift Register (LFSR) and calculates the percentage agreement between the generated LFSR sequence and a sequence read from a file.

## Usage

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/rmehmood786.git

## Functionality

find_percentage_agreement(s1, s2): Calculates the percentage agreement between two sequences of equal length.

LFSR(initial_state): Simulates LFSR operation with the provided initial state and tap sequences.

initial_state_populator(size_of_register): Populates the initial state interactively (currently commented out).

initial_tapSequence_populator(): Populates the tap sequences interactively (currently commented out).
